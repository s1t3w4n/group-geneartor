# group-generator
simple way to genearate some text files =)

I needed to create some files to upload them to another website.

These files holds data about: 240 groups, the meta data, passwords, e.t.c witch will be uses in the curent work.

This programm is generating 3 files.
1st. is the file with a JSON object witch i added to my html code. These Objects hold passwords of groups.
2nd. file holds names of the groups in cyrillic format.
3d. file is csv, which holds some data in html code format of the groups, and limits names in 40 cyrillic symbols.
